WaTor- & Trafficsimulation
==========

This project implements a WaTor simulation to analyse and show the behavior of predator-prey-models. In this implementation are sharks the predators and fishes the preys swimming together in a WAter TORus, e.g. a cyclic matrix representing the big sea.

Also a traffic simulation is implemented in manner of the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model; it is implemented for:

 - highways with a single lane and traffic lights
 - motorways with two lanes to let the cars overtake
