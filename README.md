WaTor- & Trafficsimulation
==========

This project implements a WaTor simulation to analyse and show the behavior of predator-prey-models. In this case are sharks the predators and fishes the preys swimming together in a WAter TORus, e.g. a cyclic matrix representing the big sea.

Also a traffic simulation is implemented after the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model for highways, with a single lane and traffic lights, and motorways, with two lanes to let the cars overtake if the car in front is to slow.
